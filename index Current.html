		ModBox Testing
	</h1>
	<p id="introduction">
		ModBox is a modded version of BeepBox which is an online tool for sketching and sharing instrumental melodies. 
	</p>
	<p>
		All song data is packaged into the URL at the top of your browser. 
		When you make changes to the song, the URL is updated to reflect your changes. 
		When you are satisfied with your song, just copy and paste the URL to save and share your song! 
	</p>
	
	<div class="column-container">
		<div class="instructions-column">
			<h1>
				Instructions
			</h1>
			<p>
				You can add or remove notes by clicking on the gray rows at the top. 
				ModBox automatically plays the notes out loud for you. Try it!
			</p>
			<p>
				Notes go into patterns, and you can edit one pattern at a time.
				Those numbered boxes at the bottom of the editor are the different patterns you can edit.
				<span id="bar-editing">
					Click the other boxes to move to a different part of the song, or click the arrows on the currently selected box to swap which pattern is played during that part of the song.
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				BeepBox can play several rows of patterns simultaneously, and each row has its own set of patterns. 
				Most rows can play melodies or harmonies, but the bottom row is for drums.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purple loop underneath the numbered boxes controls which part of the song is currently repeating. 
				Move the loop to listen to a different part of the song, or drag the ends to expand the loop to include the whole song. 
			</p>
			<div id="keyboard-instructions">
				<p>
					When BeepBox has focus (click on its interface above), you can use these keyboard shortcuts: <br/>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Spacebar: Pause or Resume</li>
					<li>Z: Undo</li>
					<li>Y or Shift Z: Redo</li>
					<li>C: Copy the current pattern</li>
					<li>V: Paste the current pattern</li>
					<li>[ ]: Move the playhead backward and forward</li>
					<li>Arrow Keys: Change which bar is selected</li>
					<li>1-8: Reassign a pattern to the currently selected bar</li>
					<li>- +: Shift the notes in the pattern up or down</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>
				In the note pattern editor, you can click and drag horizontally on a note to adjust its duration.
				You can also click above or below an existing note to add more notes to be played simultaneously, which is called a chord. 
			</p>
			<p>
				ADVANCED: Drag vertically from an existing note to bend its pitch, or drag vertically from above or below the note to adjust its volume.
			</p>
			<p>
				ModBox has many more features. Enabling Advanced Settings via the Prefernces Menu unlocks much more of Modbox's features!
			</p>
